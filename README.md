## About
A comprehensive data set from the NASA Meteoritical Society containing information on all of the known meteorite landings as collected by Javier de la Torre was used to plot visualizations. The data set consists of 34,513 meteorites and includes the following fields: name (name of meteorite), id (unique number), nametype (valid or relict), recclass (class type of meteorite), mass (weight)(g) , fall (fell or found), year (date of fall or found), reclat (Latitude) , reclong (Longitude) , GeoLocation(Location). The dataset was in JSON format.

## Visualizations
The visualizations include a map with markers plotting all meteorites in the dataset, a drop down to allow the user to select a certain meteorite to display its details, a bar chart showing the ten largest meteorites, a bubble chart displaying the meteroites with the overall largest mass, the top ten types of meteorites with the greatest frequency and lastly a bar chart displaying the top ten years with the most meteorite landings.
