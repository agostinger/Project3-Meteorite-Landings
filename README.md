## About
A comprehensive data set from the NASA Meteoritical Society containing information on all of the known meteorite landings as collected by Javier de la Torre was used to plot visualizations. The data set consists of 34,513 meteorites and includes the following fields: name (name of meteorite), id (unique number), nametype (valid or relict), reclass (class type of meteorite), mass (weight)(g), fall (fell or found), year (date of fall or found), reclat (Latitude), reclong (Longitude), GeoLocation(Location). The dataset was in JSON format.

## Visualizations
The visualizations include a map with markers plotting all meteorites in the dataset, a drop-down to allow the user to select a certain meteorite to display its details, a bar chart showing the ten largest meteorites, a bubble chart displaying the meteorites with the overall largest mass, the top ten types of meteorites with the greatest frequency and lastly, a bar chart displaying the top ten years with the most meteorite landings.


## Summary
The provided data set from NASA chronicles the journeys of 34,513 meteorites that have made contact with our planet, Earth! From intriguing names to the precise locations they touched down, this data set has it all. We've wrangled insights from these space travelers, especially focusing on those who have landed since the dawn of the 20th century. Notably, meteorites in the 'Iron' recclass signify the heavier category. Interestingly, 2003 was a particularly busy year for our skies; it saw a whopping 3,323 meteorites making their descent. But, here's a comforting tidbit: our visualizations reveal that massive meteorite landings weighing 1000+ grams are quite the rarity. More often than not, we're visited by lighter meteorites, like those from the L6, H5, and L5 categories.

## Conclusion
After a comprehensive analysis and visualization of meteorite landings, it's evident that such landings are not as rare as one might think. In fact, there's been a surge over the past two decades. However, there's a silver lining: most of the landings are from the lightweight category. Interestingly, while you are reading this, a meteorite might land somewhere on Earth.
